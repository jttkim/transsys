This file holds a list of bugs, missing features, and generally
desirable future developments. Please report all bugs / problems /
troubles that you come across, as well as all suggestions, to Jan T. Kim
(kim@inb.mu-luebeck.de). This list is primarily intended as a reminder /
todo list for the transsys developer(s). However, if you're bitten by
a bug or if you run into a problem, this list may help you to find out
whether the problem is already known.

Bugs in a strict sense (i.e. core dumps, incorrect expression evaluation
etc):

    * the parser does not accept empty promoters

    * the fontheight setting is not honoured in EPS mode

    * if a required transsys spec in a variable is missing, a
      "no transsys, no factor xxx" error message is printed, but
      parsing continues, returning a faulty structure that normally
      triggers a core dump somewhere down the line.

    * unknown symbols in rules don't result in a parse error either.


Features / properties that are missing

    * Error messages from parser need much improvement

    * No support for long options

    * no ``diff'' like tool for comparing transsys programs


Fundamental design / implementation issues

    * The plain C implementation uses a rather curious and probably
      error-prone memory allocation concept. The only proper way out
      of this is migration to C++ or Java. The allocation strategy
      should perhaps be documented, considering that such preliminary
      solutions often have an unexpectedly long lifetime...
