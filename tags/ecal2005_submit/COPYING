All Rights Reserved.

I plan to release transsys as free software. However, I will have to
check some issues before I can do so. In addition, no paper describing
transsys has been published yet. This release is intended primarily
for personal exchange with colleagues. For these reasons, it is
distributed under the following conditions:

    * All rights reserved.

    * No express or implied warranties.

    * You may compile, install, and modify the software for your own use.

    * You may not redistribute any part of the software, be it unmodified
      or modified.

    * You may not publish any results you obtained with the software
      without prior permission from me.

Please do not hesitate to contact me (Jan T. Kim, kim@inb.mu-luebeck.de)
if you have any questions.

Please inform me immediately if you received this release by means other
than direct reference originating from me, as this release is not intended
for distribution at large.
