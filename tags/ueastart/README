This is the initial release of transsys / ltranssys. This release just
provides the core software and is quite incomplete in many respects.
Please check http://www.inb.mu-luebeck.de/transsys/ for ongoing
development, upcoming documentation, and (hopefully much) more.

This release is not free software, see the file COPYING. (This file
does not contain a copy of the GPL, as you might expect.)

See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation
instructions.

For reporting bugs, problems, suggestions and any other information,
please send email kim@inb.mu-luebeck.de
